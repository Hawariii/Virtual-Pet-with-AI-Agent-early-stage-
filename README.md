# Virtual Pet with AI Agent (Early Stage)

An experimental **virtual pet project powered by an AI agent**.  
This project is still in its **early development stage** and serves as a playground to explore AI behavior, interaction logic, and virtual pet mechanics.

> Early Stage Warning  
> Features are incomplete, unstable, and may change frequently.

---

##  Overview

This project aims to create a **virtual pet** that can:
- React to user interactions
- Maintain internal states (mood, hunger, energy, etc.)
- Make simple decisions using an AI agent system

The main focus right now is **core logic and AI behavior**, not visuals or polish.

---

##  Current Features

- Basic AI agent logic
- Simple pet state system
- User interaction handling (early prototype)
- Modular structure for future expansion

---

##  Planned Features

- More advanced AI decision-making
- Memory & learning system
- Emotion and personality traits
- UI/visual interface
- Persistent pet data (save/load)
- Multiple pet types

---

## Tech Stack

- Language: *TBD / In development*
- AI: Rule-based / Agent-based logic (early)
- Status: Prototype

---

##  Project Status

This repository is:
- 🔬 Experimental  
- 🧪 Prototype-level  
- 🚀 Open for iteration and refactoring  

Do **not** expect production-ready code yet.
